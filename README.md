## Credits

The _real_ map editing kings are [Vexatos](https://github.com/Vexatos) and [Cruor](https://github.com/Cruor), who created Maple, Ahorn, and are working on Loenn, all found at the [Celestial Cartogrpahers github page](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers). Those tools are the ones you really want to be looking at for Celeste map building.
